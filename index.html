                <p class="description">
                    My first college programming course featured a semester-long team project developing a video game in Unity. Working with three teammates, we learned the fundamentals of collaborative development and game design.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    ITC110 taught me a crucial lesson about setting realistic expectations. As a novice developer, I set ambitious goals for our team that were far beyond what was reasonable. This project illuminated an important truth: setting the bar too high doesn't lead to greater achievement—it can actually hinder progress. Through this experience, I learned that growth requires incremental steps. An infant doesn't simply stand and walk; they spend months learning motor control, then crawling, building strength, and learning balance before taking their first steps. This principle became foundational to my approach throughout my time at ACU—baby steps.

                <p class="description">
                    A semester-long project working in a team of three, practicing Agile methodology. I specialized in UI design and implementation, creating a polished user interface for our application.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    Fast-forward two years from ITC110, and despite my growth and experience, I fell into the same trap—setting unrealistic expectations. I envisioned creating a professional-grade UI, and when I inevitably fell short of these lofty aspirations, I felt I had contributed the least to the project. Three weeks before the deadline, disappointment set in. My imposter syndrome convinced me that my talented teammates had carried the project.<br><br>
                    Then came the most powerful, perspective-setting moment: Dr. Homer's praise for our work. His genuine pride in what we accomplished provided solid evidence that my expectations had been too high. If we exceeded his expectations for the class, then my perceived lack of contribution was invalid. I did well. I worked hard and earned what I earned. Most importantly, I learned.

                <p class="description">
                    Developed "Paddle Panic," a Pong replica for a microcontroller using C. For my honors contract, I upgraded from a black-and-white display to color, introducing unique optimization challenges for the limited-resource environment.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    Unlike my other projects, this one didn't trigger an existential crisis—I just learned an incredible amount. Balancing hardware and software challenges was difficult, and the honors contract amplified this complexity. The unexpected challenge wasn't adapting code for color, but solving severe lag caused by the microcontroller's limited data transfer speed to the display. I learned an entirely new programming language (a low-level one at that), developed a framework for hyper-optimization in resource-constrained environments, and successfully troubleshot unprecedented issues. I'm genuinely proud of what I accomplished.

                <p class="description">
                    Second-year spring semester in Introduction to AI, the subject that initially drew me to computer science. I entered the class having already researched the topics independently, completing various mini-projects that replicated fundamental AI algorithms.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    Artificial Intelligence was the primary reason I chose Computer Science. Three years ago, I envisioned becoming a researcher developing cutting-edge AI algorithms. While still fascinated by AI, I've shifted toward its practical applications. Over recent years, I've enjoyed learning the nuances of various models—ChatGPT, Grok, NotebookLM, Gemini, and my current favorite, Claude. Each operates distinctly, with similarities and differences worth identifying.<br><br>
                    Dr. Arsu's AI class challenged me with complex concepts that pushed my mathematical abilities to their limits. My favorite assignments were the longer mini-projects replicating fundamental AI algorithms. Though basic compared to sophisticated LLM implementations, these projects provided essential clarity about my career direction and solidified my understanding of AI fundamentals.

                <div class="artifact-meta">Co-Curricular • Leadership</div>
                <p class="description">
                    Participated on the Sing Song leadership team for my first two years at ACU as part of the "Downstage" team, responsible for stage setup and managing props during performances throughout Sing Song weekend.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    Coming to ACU, I wanted to expand my horizons. My high school years were difficult—I lived metaphorically under a rock, lacking a community of peers I could trust and confide in. I vowed to participate in as many new experiences as possible at ACU. When Sing Song arrived freshman year, I was conflicted: I wanted to participate in this school tradition, but performing on stage was absolutely not happening. Joining the leadership team allowed me to contribute from backstage, where I felt comfortable.<br><br>
                    Initially uncertain about my role, I wondered if I'd actually contribute meaningfully. During Sing Song week, I received my fair share of work—sometimes tiring, sometimes frustrating when we sat idle. Yet I tried my best. I particularly enjoyed optimizing what should have been the most mundane task: labeling floor seating. Instead of four people each performing four tasks per chair, I reorganized the workflow so each person had one repetitive task for all chairs. Reflecting on this experience, I'm grateful I participated, applying my strengths to something I initially thought I couldn't do.

                    Competed on ACU's Speech and Debate team for my first three semesters, traveling throughout Texas and Louisiana. While I have mixed opinions about what I learned, this experience clearly contributed to my personal growth.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    Debate was certainly a season of my life—something I grew from, though I struggled with the specific style they taught. Positively, being part of this team provided a community that had my back, which was invaluable. Our student leadership genuinely cared about us—before anything else, we were family. Despite theological and political differences, we found unity by setting aside our disagreements.<br><br>
                    However, some elements frustrated me. Our debate style sometimes felt insignificant or irrelevant. While we were supposed to stay informed about current events, we'd debate topics like "What the best pokemon was" with baseless arguments crammed together in 15 minutes—not carefully considered argumentation, but "speedran" points that were often plainly wrong yet had to be argued anyway. As I reflect on this experience, I'm glad I was part of this team, though not for the reasons I expected. It's amazing how God uses things in unexpected ways.

                    Began attending University Church of Christ (UCC) fall semester, finding a community that cares for me and opportunities to serve meaningfully. This traditional Church of Christ congregation became my spiritual home at ACU.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    Before coming to ACU, I researched and found a church that felt like home during my visit. Despite attending for nearly two years and participating in a weekly home group, I never felt truly connected—relationships remained surface-level "see you next week" interactions. I'm grateful for those people, but my UCC experience became exactly what I needed.<br><br>
                    I joke about "church hopping" at the end of my ACU journey, but I fell into it naturally. My first visit wasn't for Sunday service but for their Wednesday community dinner. A friend invited me, and after dinner, I joined their college group. It was fun, and I was invited for Sunday. Without a car to reach my former church, I walked to UCC. Coming from a non-denominational background, this traditional Church of Christ was different, but I loved it. I'm glad to call this place home and extremely grateful for everyone who has poured into my life.

                    After not securing an external internship, I continued my on-campus position with ACU Advancement remotely through the summer. Though challenging and not always engaging, this experience taught valuable lessons about remote work.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection">
                    During second-year spring semester, I started working part-time for ACU's Advancement department—a mixed experience of boredom and stress. Unable to secure a summer internship, my former boss offered remote work, which I accepted. This being my first remote position, I learned many lessons the hard way.<br><br>
                    Remote work was extremely difficult. The hardest aspect was separating home life from work life. The room I slept in was down the hall from my workspace, making it mentally exhausting to work 4-5 hours daily while managing multiple summer courses. Ironically, I didn't learn the lessons the internship course intended. Instead, I discovered how challenging remote work is and that it's not for me. Remote work transformed from the most "desirable" flexible option to my least preferred—very, very quickly.

                    You know, it is extremely difficult to believe that I am already here writing this reflection. It seems like it was just yesterday I was sitting in Professor Tanner's ITC class in COBA 301—yet here we are. Reflecting academically is hard for me... because if there is any common theme to me (at least as I have portrayed throughout this portfolio) it's that I set too high of a bar for myself. Formerly, I found myself with an expectation of walking away with more than I have, but at this very moment, I realize just how grateful I am for that which I have. While I do wish I could have done more projects and prepared for industry a little more, I am happy with what I have done. I remember being in P1 thinking I knew it all. I was coming into P1 on fire. I knew arrays. I knew variables. I knew for-loops and while-loops. Heck, I had taught myself Python! P2 quickly humbled me. I realized just how much I didn't know. And now looking back, seeing P2 two years in the rear-view mirror, and seeing the progress that I have made is incredible!

                <p class="reflection">
                    While I am hesitant to say it, my experience here at ACU has shaped my spiritual life far more than anything close to that academically. As mentioned elsewhere, I came to ACU rather broken. I had never experienced true friendship, at least as I know it now. I hadn't seen God work as I have now seen him work. I am trying not to cry as I write this, just thinking how much I have grown in my faith. How much the Lord has given me... When I first decided I wanted to come to ACU, I didn't actually know if I'd be able to. But by some miracle, finances aligned, which I believe to be providence of God. Come the end of my first year, I did not know about the second, but money seemed to just show up. And this last third year, the same thing. God brought me here for some reason, and he has kept me here. He has granted me so many wonderful friendships, through whom I have learned so so much. I love dearly all of my friends and by far the hardest part for me right now is thinking about leaving. Okay, I am crying. And while I struggle with something right now, I know that his will will be for my good and his ultimate glory. Despite how much I may sometimes complain about expectations, I will forget those things. I won't forget truly what I have been given here.
